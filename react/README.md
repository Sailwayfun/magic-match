# Magic Match

This is a memory card game built with React and Tailwind CSS. The project is inspired by NetNinJa's YouTube course, focusing on leveraging more advanced Front-End tools.

- Used Tailwind CSS to quickly build up the user interface.
- useReducer hook is used to decouple the state logic with component UI.
- TypeScript helps add static type checking, to make code more readable and maintainable.
